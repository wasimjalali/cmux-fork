# FORK.md - Wasim's cmux fork

This is a personal fork of [manaflow-ai/cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux). It carries
custom features that do not exist upstream. This file documents what those features are, which files
they live in, and the exact loop to pull in a new upstream version without losing them.

Agent rule overrides for this fork live in `.claude/rules/wasim-overrides.md`.

Keep this file fork-only. Upstream never touches `FORK.md`, so it never causes a merge conflict.
That is the whole point: our fork notes live here, not in `CLAUDE.md` (which upstream owns and edits).

## Remotes

- `origin` -> `https://github.com/wasimjalali/cmux-fork.git` (our fork)
- `upstream` -> `https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux.git` (the real cmux)

## Our custom features

### 1. Sidebar folder drag-and-drop

Drop a folder onto the sidebar to open it as a new workspace. The workspace shows the folder name
and auto-runs `claude` in it.

Design and plan docs:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-sidebar-folder-drop-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-sidebar-folder-drop.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-sidebar-folder-drop-v2.md`

### 2. App-wide zoom on Cmd+= / Cmd+-

Cmd+= zooms the entire app in (sidebar, tab bar, terminals, panels, chrome), Cmd+- zooms out.
It drives the existing `GlobalFontMagnification` percent (50-200%, steps of 10, persisted in
UserDefaults), so the zoom level survives restarts. The chords are routed before the per-pane
browser/markdown/terminal zooms; unbind `globalZoomIn` / `globalZoomOut` in Settings >
Keyboard Shortcuts to get upstream's per-pane behavior back. Also exposed in the command
palette ("App Zoom In" / "App Zoom Out").

New shortcut actions: `globalZoomIn`, `globalZoomOut` (in both `KeyboardShortcutSettings.Action`
and the `CmuxSettings` `ShortcutAction` mirror; the drift test keeps them aligned).

## Files the fork owns or changes

Knowing this list is what makes updates safe. When an upstream merge conflicts, it will only ever be
in the "modified upstream files" group below. The "fork-only" files never conflict.

**Fork-only new files** (upstream does not have these, so they never conflict):

- `Sources/DirectoryDropFilter.swift`
- `Sources/SidebarDropRegionProbe.swift`
- `Sources/SidebarDropRegionRegistry.swift`
- `cmuxTests/DirectoryDropFilterTests.swift`
- `cmuxTests/SidebarDropRegionRegistryTests.swift`
- `Packages/macOS/CmuxFoundation/Tests/CmuxFoundationTests/GlobalFontMagnificationSteppingTests.swift`
- the three docs listed above

**Modified upstream files for app-wide zoom** (conflict surface for that feature):

- `Packages/macOS/CmuxFoundation/Sources/CmuxFoundation/GlobalFontMagnification.swift` - step helpers
- `Sources/KeyboardShortcutSettings.swift`, `Sources/AppDelegate.swift`,
  `Sources/AppDelegate+CanvasShortcutRouting.swift` - `globalZoomIn`/`globalZoomOut` actions + routing
- `Packages/macOS/CmuxSettings/Sources/CmuxSettings/Values/ShortcutAction.swift` (+`+Defaults.swift`) - mirror enum
- `Sources/ContentView.swift`, `Sources/ContentView+ViewCommandPalette.swift` - command palette entries
- `Packages/macOS/CmuxSettingsUI/Sources/CmuxSettingsUI/Sections/AppSection.swift` - subtitle copy
- `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`, `web/data/cmux-shortcuts.ts`, `web/data/cmux.schema.json`,
  `skills/cmux-settings/references/shortcut-actions.md` - strings, docs, schema
- `cmuxTests/KeyboardShortcutContextTests.swift` - default-chord regression test

**Modified upstream files** (this is the conflict surface, check these on every merge):

- `Sources/ContentView.swift` - wires in the drop overlay. Look for `onFoldersDroppedOnSidebar`
  and `.background(SidebarDropRegionProbe())`.
- `Sources/FileDropOverlayView.swift` - fork edits to the drop overlay.
- `Sources/FileDropOverlayViewHitTesting.swift` - fork edits to hit testing.
- `cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - wires the new Swift files into the Xcode target.
- `.gitignore` - adds `build-release/`.

## The update loop (run this every time upstream ships a new version)

Follow these steps whenever you want to pull a new cmux version into the fork. This is the system
that keeps our features. Never click the in-app Sparkle "Update" button as your way of updating; that
only swaps the installed binary and does nothing for our source. Updates happen here, in git.

Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the target version (e.g. `v0.64.19`).

```bash
# 0. Start clean on the feature branch that holds our work.
git checkout feat/sidebar-folder-drop
git status   # must be clean

# 1. Get the new upstream version and tags.
git fetch upstream --tags

# 2. See what is coming and where it might conflict with us.
#    BASE is the merge-base; the last arg is the new tag.
BASE=$(git merge-base feat/sidebar-folder-drop vX.Y.Z)
comm -12 \
  <(git diff --name-only $BASE feat/sidebar-folder-drop | sort) \
  <(git diff --name-only $BASE vX.Y.Z | sort)
#    -> the printed files are the only possible conflicts. Expect them to be a
#       subset of the "modified upstream files" list above.

# 3. Do the merge on a dedicated integration branch (keeps the feature branch safe).
git checkout -b merge/upstream-vX.Y.Z feat/sidebar-folder-drop
git merge vX.Y.Z --no-edit
```

### Resolving conflicts

- **`Sources/*.swift`**: keep BOTH sides. Our drop code and upstream's new code should coexist.
  After resolving, confirm our hooks are still present:
  ```bash
  grep -n "onFoldersDroppedOnSidebar\|SidebarDropRegionProbe" Sources/ContentView.swift
  ```
- **`cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`**: this conflicts because both sides add file entries in the
  same sorted region. The fix is union (keep both), then let the normalizer re-sort:
  ```bash
  # strip only the conflict-marker lines (keeps both sides everywhere)
  grep -vE '^(<<<<<<< HEAD|=======|>>>>>>> vX\.Y\.Z)$' cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj > pbx.tmp
  mv pbx.tmp cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
  python3 scripts/normalize-pbxproj.py
  bash scripts/check-pbxproj.sh                 # must exit 0
  bash scripts/lint-pbxproj-test-wiring.sh      # must say ok
  git add cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
  ```
  Then confirm every fork file is still wired (4 refs each is normal):
  ```bash
  for f in DirectoryDropFilter SidebarDropRegionProbe SidebarDropRegionRegistry \
           FileDropOverlayView FileDropOverlayViewHitTesting \
           DirectoryDropFilterTests SidebarDropRegionRegistryTests; do
    echo "$f: $(grep -c "$f.swift" cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)"
  done
  ```
- **`.gitignore`**: trivial, keep both sides.

### After conflicts are resolved

```bash
# 4. Sync submodules to the merged pointers (upstream often bumps ghostty / bonsplit).
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 5. Commit the merge.
git commit --no-edit

# 6. Build. reload.sh runs ensure-ghosttykit.sh, which repoints GhosttyKit.xcframework
#    to the new ghostty SHA automatically.
./scripts/reload.sh --tag merge-vX-Y-Z

# 7. Run our regression tests.
xcodebuild test -project cmux.xcodeproj -scheme cmux -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:cmuxTests/DirectoryDropFilterTests \
  -only-testing:cmuxTests/SidebarDropRegionRegistryTests

# 8. Push the merge branch to the fork, then dogfood the tagged build.
git push -u origin merge/upstream-vX.Y.Z
```

Dogfood the built app first (drag a folder onto the sidebar, confirm it opens a workspace and runs
claude). Only after it works, fast-forward the feature branch to the merge:

```bash
git checkout feat/sidebar-folder-drop
git merge --ff-only merge/upstream-vX.Y.Z
git push origin feat/sidebar-folder-drop
```

A PR on the fork is optional for a version sync. The real diff is ~1000+ files of already-reviewed
upstream code, so a bot review is mostly noise. The substance to check is the conflict resolution and
that the feature still works, which the build + regression tests already prove. Open a PR only if you
want the record.

## Build toolchain on this machine (zig / Ghostty CLI helper)

The Xcode build has a "Build Ghostty CLI helper" run-script phase that needs a specific zig. Two
gotchas hit this machine when building v0.64.19:

1. **Exact zig version.** The phase requires exactly `zig 0.15.2`. Homebrew here has `0.16.0`, which
   the strict check rejects. Zig 0.15.2 is installed isolated at
   `~/.cache/cmux/zig/zig-aarch64-macos-0.15.2/zig` (Homebrew's 0.16.0 untouched). Point the build
   at it with `CMUX_ZIG`:
   ```bash
   export CMUX_ZIG="$HOME/.cache/cmux/zig/zig-aarch64-macos-0.15.2/zig"
   ```
   To reinstall it later: `ZIG_FORCE_LOCAL_INSTALL=1 ZIG_INSTALL_ROOT="$HOME/.cache/cmux/zig" bash scripts/install-zig-ci.sh`

2. **zig 0.15.2 vs the macOS 26 SDK.** Even with the right zig, the helper's build-runner fails to
   link libSystem on macOS 26 (undefined `_sigaction`, `_waitpid`, etc.). This is a zig/SDK problem,
   not a cmux or fork problem. For local dogfood builds, skip the real helper and build a stub (the
   terminal still works via GhosttyKit; only the standalone bundled `ghostty` CLI is a stub):
   ```bash
   CMUX_SKIP_ZIG_BUILD=1 ./scripts/reload.sh --tag <tag>
   ```
   A proper release build needs the real helper, which CI builds in a controlled environment. Do not
   ship a `CMUX_SKIP_ZIG_BUILD=1` build as a release.

## Notes

- The `ghostty` and `vendor/bonsplit` submodules track upstream. Our fork does not modify them, so
  the merge always takes upstream's newer pointer. No submodule conflict expected.
- `GhosttyKit.xcframework` is a symlink into `~/.cache/cmux/ghosttykit/<ghostty-sha>-.../`. Do not
  edit it by hand. `scripts/ensure-ghosttykit.sh` (called by `reload.sh`) points it at the right SHA.
- If a future upstream version renames or heavily rewrites `ContentView.swift`,
  `FileDropOverlayView.swift`, or `FileDropOverlayViewHitTesting.swift`, the merge conflict there may
  need real reintegration, not just union. That is the one case to slow down and read both sides.
